## Resizable Array with Python

Resizable/Dynamic Array is my 3rd semester course Data Structures and Algorithms project.

This project contains following Methods:

1) **insert_at_first**
	Insert value before head of an Array.

2) **insert_at_end**
	Insert value at last at last, It resize the Array as values get inserted.

3) **insert_at_middle**
	Takes two inputs insertedvalue(value going to be inserted) and Insertafter(value after which we want to insert new value), It also Resize the array.

4) **delete_at_first**
	Deletes Value at first index(0) with that size of list get decreased.

5) **delete_at_end**
	deletes Value at last index with that size of list get decreased.

6) **shrink**
	Takes one input(value going to be deleted), It deletes that particular value which shrinks the size of array.

7) **minimum_value**
	Returns minimum value in Array.

8) **maximum_value**
	Returns maximum value in Array.
9) **printarray**
	Returns Array


First of all get started by cloning this repository on your machine.  
```ruby
git clone git@github.com:rawheel/Resizable-Array-python.git 
```

Now,

- Run **resizable_array.py**
